I am a computational social scientist at [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/)'s [Data Labs](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/about-data-labs/) Team. I previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher of Sociology and Computational Social Science at [Indiana University Bloomington, the Department of Sociology](https://sociology.indiana.edu/index.html). 

My research focuses on studying behavior from a social network perspective, with particular areas of interest in social interaction in online platforms and health behaviors. My academic publications appeared in *Addiction*, *American Behavioral Scientist*, *PLoS ONE*, *Social Media + Society*, among other outlets.

I received my MA and PhD in Sociology from the [University of Arizona](https://sociology.arizona.edu/), and by BA and MA in Economics from [Boğaziçi University](https://econ.boun.edu.tr/).
