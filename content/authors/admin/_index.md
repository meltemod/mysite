I am a quantitative research scientist and  leader with over ten years of experience 
designing and delivering complex social science research projects that drive data-informed 
decisions for the public good.

My leadership is grounded in meaningful and authentic relationships, a continuous curiosity for learning, 
and a commitment to strategic, forward-thinking solutions. I believe leadership is not defined 
by a title but by how one shows up to everyday situations—with curiosity, care, and a vision for impact. 
I strive to lead in a way that builds trust, inspires action, and creates space for others to grow, 
while charting clear, purposeful paths toward shared goals.

In my current role at the [Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/), 
I lead improvements to research processes 
and tools within the [*Adding It Up*](https://www.guttmacher.org/adding-it-up) program, 
which estimates the need for, impact of, 
and costs associated with essential sexual and reproductive health services. 
I work closely with cross-functional teams to enhance the program’s research infrastructure 
and produce data that informs global health policy.

Previously, at  [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/)'s 
[Data Labs](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/about-data-labs/), 
I led and contributed to research projects on 
topics ranging from education and health to social media and news consumption.
 I employed large-scale datasets, advanced statistical techniques, and data storytelling 
 to uncover public opinion trends and communicate findings to broad audiences through engaging, 
 accessible reports. [Reports>>](https://www.pewresearch.org/staff/meltem-odabas/)

Earlier in my career, I served as a postdoctoral researcher at Indiana University Bloomington, 
where I collaborated with an interdisciplinary team to analyze a large-scale private health claims dataset, 
revealing insights into health behaviors and outcomes related to the U.S. opioid epidemic.

I hold a PhD and an MA in Sociology from the University of Arizona, 
and an MA and a BA in Economics from Boğaziçi University (İstanbul, Türkiye).
