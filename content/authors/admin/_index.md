I am a computational social scientist at [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/)'s [Data Labs](https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/about-data-labs/) Team. With a PhD in Sociology and MAs in Economics and Sociology, I have over 10 years of experience in conducting social science research, data analysis, and visualization.

My research interests include digital technology, social media use, and the relationship between social interaction and cultural formation.

My research publications at Pew are [available online](https://www.pewresearch.org/staff/meltem-odabas/).
 
My academic publications appeared in *Addiction*, *American Behavioral Scientist*, *PLoS ONE*, and *Social Media + Society*, among other outlets.

I previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher of Sociology and Computational Social Science at [Indiana University Bloomington, Department of Sociology](https://sociology.indiana.edu/index.html). 

I received my MA and PhD in Sociology from the [University of Arizona](https://sociology.arizona.edu/), and by BA and MA in Economics from [Boğaziçi University](https://econ.boun.edu.tr/).
